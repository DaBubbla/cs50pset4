This is Harvard's CS50

Inside you'll find the projects I have completed pertaining to week 3 -problem set 4

whodunit - Takes a garbled bitmap image and I've decrypted the image by changing all the
static surrounding a secret message. Randomized pixels were changed to RED and all others were
left alone.

resize - Given some of the images from whodunit, we've been asked to resize them according
to a command line argument. An addiional argument was added to the equation. At this
point in time, the program will resize smiley.bmp correctly but others (eg small.bmp) will
not resize without jumping and creating odd images.

recover - haven't touched this one yet.
